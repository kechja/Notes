## How do I tell a "senior" developer that his system design is garbage?

Depends on your desired end result, really.

- To annoy him: ‘Your design is garbage, Bob’
- To stir dissent: ‘Hey Dave, have you seen how garbage Bob’s design is?’
- To create confusion: ‘But what about the X? We should Y the Z but then the B might A so we need to C the D but your design does E making it an F’ Use highly obscure jargon for full effect
- To make a meeting awkward:’Bobs design is garbage, people!’
- To learn: ‘Bob, I see you’ve done this differently to me. Can you walk me through the key choices you made and why?’
- To suggest alternatives: ‘Bob, I think I can see a change to area X which has advantage Y. Can we talk about that for a minute, I want to hear your thoughts’
